## Contents
The content is focused to the type of applications GARAIO AG typically develops as well as the tools and toolchain typically used for that. This includes mainly following tools:
* Azure DevOps (Code and Release Management, Pipelines)
* Visual Studio / Visual Studio Core (Engineering)
* Power BI (Analytics)

### Knowledge
In that folder various "Knowhow", "Tips & Tricks" and "Best Practices" content is collected, e.g. regarding setup of Azure service configurations or selection of most appropriate Azure Service for specific requirements.

| Type | Scope | Description | Link |
|------|-------|-------------|------|
| Best Practices | Power BI | Tips for creating valuable Application Dashboards to empower the project/product team with deep knowledge | [Show](./Knowledge/BestPractices-PowerBI-ApplicationDashboards) |
| Best Practices | Azure Solutions | Overview of services used and usable for monitoring and analytics, its relations and best practices to use them in PaaS/Serverless architectures | [Show](./Knowledge/BestPractices-AzureSolutions-Monitoring) |
| Best Practices | App Registrations | App Registrations are often used by resources such as Bot Service or App Services / Functions to grant access to API's or for user authentication. With a continuous deployment approach, there are certain challenges to ensure correct availability and continuity with the secret lifecycle. | [Show](./Knowledge/BestPractices-AppRegistrations) |
| Knowhow | Azure Bot Service | Infographic (or schematic architecture) displaying the relationship of the various components and resources to build and run Azure Bot Service implementations. Includes Power Virtual Agent and Bot Framework tools such as the Composer or Emulator. | [Show](./Knowledge/Knowhow-AzureBotService-Overview) |
| Tips & Tricks | Azure Management REST API | For almost every resource type as well as for the central Azure Resource Manager there is a [comprehensive REST API provided, which is also well documented](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/). However, the documentation and most of other internet resources just demonstrate how to authenticate a service principal for application access. This requires you to assign according permissions to resources (RBAC), which is not always wanted or even possible. For API calls with Postman you maybe want a delegated access based on your personal account. | [Show](./Knowledge/TipsAndTricks-ManagementApi-Postman) |
| Best Practices | Azure Cost Management | How to enhance the Azure Cost controlling in your subscriptions by the setup of Budget and associated alerts.|[Show](./Knowledge/BestPractices-CostManagement/)|
