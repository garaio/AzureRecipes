# Central API Management
With the popularity of the "API-First" philosophy, many companies want to be or become API-driven and demonstrate openness for ecosystems. One key part of that is often a central documentation and management of all API's available, including its accessibility. This may be central for the whole enterprise or for departments of it. There is also quite a lot of pattern and blueprint documentation of how to concept such a solution, for example the [Enterprise Integration article in the Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/enterprise-integration/basic-enterprise-integration).
